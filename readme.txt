1. Summary
The PadSynth music synthesizer offers an innovative input interface, which is based on a multi touch paradigm for sound synthesis. 

2. Tested on API 1.6. Targeting API 2.0 for Multitouch, pending device availability.

2. Developed on MacOS, Tested on T-Mobile G1 with Android 1.6

3. No dependencies

The Sine and Saw wave works but the Triangle and Square waves produce a white noise like sound which
